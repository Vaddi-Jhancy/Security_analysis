Implemented a TLS client in Python to establish secure connections, perform handshakes, validate server certificates, and capture traffic using Wireshark.

Analyzed certificate validation, hostname verification, and TLSâ€“TCP relationship; extended implementation to send HTTP requests securely over TLS.

Conducted website vulnerability assessment using Nmap (port scanning, service detection, CVE checks) and Burp Suite (traffic interception, active scanning).

Identified misconfigurations (open ports, directory listing, risky HTTP methods) and proposed mitigations (HSTS, HTTPS-only redirection, WAF, access restrictions).

Tools: Python (ssl, socket), Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite.
